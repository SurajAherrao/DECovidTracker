            • Passengers traveling to the US are required to present a negative
            COVID-19 test result or documentation of recovery. Also fully
            vaccination is compulsory.
          </p>

            • Passports must be in good condition. United may not accept
            passengers for international travel and may deny boarding if a
            passport is damaged beyond normal wear and tear and/or there is
            evidence of intentional or material alterations or mutilations
          </p>
          <p>
            • U.S. regulations always require travelers to comply with customs
            and immigration procedures at their first point of entry into the
            U.S. Travelers will need to have all required documents with them
            upon arrival — even if the U.S. is not their final destination. If
            travelers have more than one U.S. stopover, they will not need to
            clear customs again.
          </p>
          <p>
            • In addition to any travel document requirements for departure,
            customers must satisfy travel document requirements for entry into
            the destination country and, depending on the itinerary, for transit
            through a country. Note that US require passports to be valid for at
            least six months.
